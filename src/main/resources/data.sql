He was first to start a systematic classification of schientific exploits of his time laying basis for many branches of science. His philosophical views are less rigid and more dialictical than those of Plato, as was his vision of politics, with an enlightened ruler, such as Alexandre, at the head of a state.');

His dialectical method, also known as the Socratic method, lies at the basis of European critical free-thiking. Unfortunately it also cost Socrates his life eventually, as his undermining critical view of his contemporary morals and politics became increasingly threatening to the Athens authorities.');
INSERT INTO philosopher(id, name, description) VALUES (20003, 'Protagoras', 'Protagoras was sophist philosopher and a contemporary of Plato. As the Platonic, and later Christian, views prevailed, every divergent thinking was pushed into oblivion and even destroyed. All we have left of Protagoras are a few facts and phrases preserved in bias reports by his winning opponents. Yet this gives us a notion of a daring relativist who opted to blade run the ethical dilemmas of human condition while irreputable truths were still a norm.');
INSERT INTO philosopher(id, name, description) VALUES (20004, 'St.Augustine', 'A prominent theologician and one of the most respected fathers of the Christian church, Saint-Augustine began as a decadent and a neo-Platonic philosopher only to turn to faith later. Due to his effort, the Platonic ideas became thouroughly incorporated into the Western Christianity. His original ideas, that survive up till today, are of the divine grace, the original sin, the just war and the very concept of the Holy Trinity. His concept of the two cities, one of the the immortal holy city of God, goes along the lines of the platonic story of the cave and the bright world of immortal devine ideas.');
INSERT INTO philosopher(id, name, description) VALUES (20005, 'Plato', 'A student of Socrates, Plato was an idealist thinker and a prominent homosexual, hence the later misinterpreted idea of "platonic love". It is interesting to know that his ideal of state system was a caste-based dictatorship, his view of women rather derogative, and his definition of life in itself upright descouraging. His most prominent legacy is a a notion of this world being build as a reflection of a perfect world of ideas, that would contain an ideal pattern for each thing present. Was later taken over in a modified form by the Christianity and can still be traced in various ways of thinking in modern culture.');
INSERT INTO philosopher(id, name, description) VALUES (20006, 'Nietzsche', 'The first famous nihilist with a rather troublesome relationship with the God gather-figure, Nietzsche is charched with inventing the ubermensch and inspiring Wagner and Hitler alike. His famous announcement that -God is dead and we killed him- heralded the niew atheistic and existentialist attitude towards reality. His answer to the problem was to promote the idea of ubermensch, a new sort of human being unbounded by conventional morals and ideas. An idea that appealed to the nazi culture and led to redesigning of Western morals.');
INSERT INTO philosopher(id, name, description) VALUES (20007, 'Kant', 'A German classic philosopher to whom we owe many ideas behind the Declaration of Human rights, Kant saw reason as the main unifying characteristic of human species. Rationality was the basis of his idea of faith, religion and ethics, too. Morality was in direct connecion with reason and as such - its logical outcome. Kant made an important contribution to the theory of cognition and science by his notion of ding an sich, a true natural object that we cannot penetrate but only learn by proxy, by a mental construct due to our physical limitations (e.g. nuclear physics or black holes).');
INSERT INTO philosopher(id, name, description) VALUES (20008, 'Heidegger', 'One of the most influential philosophers of the past century, Heidegger is hard to classify, since his main concern lies not with the objectivity of the external world but with its perception. Not a subjectivist as such, Heidegger found the idea of being itself, as a presence (dasein) of every thing in the world, fascinating. Dasein is for him more than mere presence, but an active awareness of living beings in the world that upholds it. Dasein is intentional and means care for the world and its things. Unfortunately Heidegger also collaborated with the nazi regime which to an extent smeared his image in the West.');

He managed to find the basis of thought and human existance in the mental process of cognition making it the major characteristic of humanity. His is also credited with the invention of the Cartesian coordinate system and analytical geometry. He also denied the divine explanation of the natural phenomena. Another controversial thesis by Descarte was that animals have no soul and are mere authomatons, which paved the way to further exploitation of nature in the industrial era.');

A socialist by conviction, Sartre distantiated himself from the USSR politics. His wife, a French feminist and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, and Sartre himself actively promoted the feminist agenda. Many of Sartres works are written in a form of a play. His main focus was on anthropology, seeing life as meaningless and godless, with human beings being sentenced to create their own meaning of life while constantly causing each other pain through persuing their own interests.');
INSERT INTO philosopher(id, name, description) VALUES (20012, 'Karl Marx', 'If not a most elaborate thinker, Marx certainly remains one of the most influential so far. The creater of communism and an excellent economy theoritician, Marx is accounted among the prominent political and social philosophers of the modern era. Instrumental to his political views, his philosophy can arguably be couted as an ideologically tainted attempt at digesting Hegels metaphysics. While ignoring Hegels Absoluter Geist, Marx adopts his theory of spyral dynamics of social, political and historical development and uses it as the base for his class struggle theory. Another feature of Marxs philosophy is the dye-hard materialism that leaves no space for any traces of transcedency.');
